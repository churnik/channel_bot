This bot is not as good as @junction_bot, but it does it's job

the main thing of this bot is that you don't have to pay for unlimited number of channels, unlike in [@junction_bot](https://t.me/junction_bot), 
because we didn't setup payment :)

But also because you can setup this bot on your machine.

For that you need to:
1. have python â‰¥ 3.6
1. setup mongodb
2. install requirement via `pip3 install requirements.txt`
3. copy `config_example.py` in to `config.py`
4. fill file with required data
5. launch bot via `python3 bot.py`
